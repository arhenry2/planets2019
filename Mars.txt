I visited Mars. I was told it was cold and dry, yet the red was absolutely 
~dashing~. We'll see if my peeps like it.

The two moons may be a problem for WolfMan, but it's not like he's coming anyway!
*evil laugh*

The dryness will please Mr. Mummy. I'm still working out if I'm including him. 
After all, if Earth is dying from pollution and warming up, it'll be dry, right?
Maybe he'll be better on Earth after all. I will ask and report back tomorrow.

Someday I dream of butterflies on fire, but I think they like the warmth?
